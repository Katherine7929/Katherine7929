                 <p>Welcome to my first website, I am very glad I can start to step out my comfort zone and learn new things.This is my first semester taking any course related to Multimedia, I have created a web in the past but it is my first time using Brackets! I have created some images throughout the semester and have captured unforgettable and meaningful pictures. Come explore my first website!</p>
