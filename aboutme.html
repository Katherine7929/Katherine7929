                  <h1> About Katherine</h1>
                 
                 <p>Welcome to my first website, I am Katherine Pinos I am very proud to say that this is my last full time semester in BMCC and I am planning to transfer to John Jay during FALL 2024. I am the first to graduate from a community college but continue their education and stick to my desired career.</p>
         <p>I currently work with children at an after school program in Brooklyn and their ages vary from five to 10 year olds, I can say it can be challenging at times but they have also helped me build confidence over the past 4 years. I am also planning to be part of the education system somewhere in the future, but well see!  </p>
